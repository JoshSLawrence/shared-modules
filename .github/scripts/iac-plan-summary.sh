# Renders the markdown summary of an iac/ plan to stdout. The iac workflow
# posts it on the PR and in the job summary; iac-plan.sh calls this script.
# Safe to run locally against a saved plan:
#
#   tofu show -json tfplan > plan.json && tofu show -no-color tfplan > plan.txt
#   PLAN_JSON=plan.json PLAN_TEXT=plan.txt .github/scripts/iac-plan-summary.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   PLAN_EXIT_CODE - exit code of `tofu plan -detailed-exitcode` (default 0).
#                    0 or 2 renders the plan; anything else renders a failure.
#   PLAN_JSON      - `tofu show -json` output (required unless the plan failed)
#   PLAN_TEXT      - `tofu show -no-color` output (required unless the plan
#                    failed)
#   PLAN_LOG       - output of the failed plan, quoted when the plan failed
#   MAX_PLAN_CHARS - budget for the quoted plan/log (default 50000). GitHub
#                    rejects comments over 65536 characters, so the rest of
#                    the comment has to fit in what's left.
#   HEAD_SHA, TARGET_BRANCH, TARGET_SHA, PR_NUMBER - describe what was planned
#                    (set by the workflow; optional locally)
